## A link to an article or web site 
Please see [Interesting Facts About Software Development: Statistics](https://apiumhub.com/tech-blog-barcelona/interesting-facts-software-development/#4_Hiring_and_retaining_talent) for an interesting article I found. 

## A paragraph about what I find interesting about it 
I found this article to be quite interesting because it talked about many statistics about the popularity of different languages, company's most important hiring criteria, and so on. One thing specifically I found to be really surprising is that college degree and various certifications are two of the least important hiring criteria. I was always told that college degree is crucial for one's career, but I guess after all, it is one's technical skill and willingness to learn that are the most important.
