## A link to an article or web site 
Please see [Interesting Facts About Software Development: Statistics](https://apiumhub.com/tech-blog-barcelona/interesting-facts-software-development/#4_Hiring_and_retaining_talent) for an interesting article I found. 

## A paragraph about what I find interesting about it 
I found this article to be quite interesting because it talked about many statistics about the popularity of different languages, company's most important hiring criteria, and so on. One thing specifically I found to be really surprising is that college degree and various certifications are two of the least important hiring criteria. I was always told that college degree is crucial for one's career, but I guess after all, it is one's technical skill and willingness to learn that are the most important.

It's actually interesting but not surprising to see that JavaScript actually took the largest account for all the programming languages that company's using; It's admittedly that JavaScript is quite a loose language with quite a lot weird function that scares people. Yet still it's a very important and popular, especially with NOde.JS, which represents the idea of "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm. 
great statistics for motivating learning JavaScript!
